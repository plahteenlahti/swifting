# Day 1

Here's the basics of of Swift I learned today:

1. Variables (Nothing new)
2. Strings and integers (large numbers can be written using underscores 100_000)
3. Multi-line strings (use three quote marks """, escape line breaks with \n)
4. Doubles and booleans (old news)
5. String interpolation ( use \(variable))
6. Constants (basically just let)
7. Type annotations (almost like typescript)

That's it. Most of it was old news. Some were just new grammar. See you tomorrow!
