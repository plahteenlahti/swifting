# Operators and conditions

Ok, this was a little boring because it was so familiar already. However the switch cases fallthrough and range operator were interesting new additions. In addition those I also reviewed these:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Operator overloading
3. Compound assignment operators
4. Comparison operators
5. Conditions
6. Combining conditions
7. The ternary operator
8. Switch statements
9. Range operators
10. Operators and conditions summary
