Finally something I'm at least a little familiar with. I might have said that tuples are like object, but actually it's structs that resemble them more. However they are much more interesting that object in terms of how powerful they are. E.g.:

- You can make values inside them public or private
- You can lazily initialize values
- They can have static properties
