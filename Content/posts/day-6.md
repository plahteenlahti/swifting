Closures are something. Not exactly sure what but something. You write them like this:

```
let payment = { () -> Bool in
    print("Paying an anonymous personâ€¦")
    return true
}
```

This one is a little different, as it highlights the functionality of closures to return values also without accepting them. They kind of look like JavaScript object and arrow syntax had a sick child.

I'm not sure what these are used for.
